# ✈️ Airline Database SQL Capstone Project  

This project explores an **Airline Database** using SQL to extract meaningful insights.  
I performed queries related to **passenger details, flight operations, and revenue analysis**.  

## 🔧 Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Airline Database (provided during Skillovilla course)

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Wrote **complex queries** to extract business insights.  
- Analyzed **passenger data, ticket sales, and revenue trends**.  
- Performed **joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and window functions**.  
- Built a structured approach to querying real-world data.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Queries/` → SQL query files.  
- `Output_Snapshots/` → Screenshots of results.  
- `ER_Diagram.png` → Database schema.  

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in SQL query writing, business data interpretation, and database analysis.
